# Solidity Transfer Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity transfer functions: insufficient balance checks without a proper revert mechanism.  The `transfer` function lacks a revert statement in case the `require` check fails. This leads to potential partial state changes and inconsistency. The solution demonstrates the correct use of `require` combined with a `revert` statement to ensure atomicity.
